    "\n",
    ">It is important to determine if customers will convert from free-tier to paying customers. We want to create a model to predict the determinants for a customer's conversion, so as to better direct marketing and sales efforts, and also to predict earnings for the company. \n",

    "Exploratory Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the lab from a class as a guide, create an exploratory analysis plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the goals of the exploratory analysis?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   >Answer: Exploratory analysis allows for better understanding of the data, to describe the data structure and information that has been collected, as well as to explore variables and data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. a) What are the assumptions of the distribution of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer: A normal distribution is often assumed. The central limit theorem is also a fundamental tool, which states that with some assumptions, sampling distributions are normal with a specific mean and variance. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. b) How will you determine the distribution of your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer: Descriptive statistics will be reported, followed by measures of skewness and kurtosis, and histogram/box plots. \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. a) How might outliers impact your analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer: Outliers increase error variance and reduce the power of statistical tests. If non-randomly distributed, they can decrease normality and also bias or influence estimates. \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. b) How will you test for outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer: Visual inspection of the data, measures of the mean, median, standard deviation and variance will help to identify outlying data points. \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. a) What is colinearity?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   >Answer: It is a phenomenon in which two (or more) predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated. In this situation, the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or in the data. \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. b) How will you test for colinearity?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer: Tests of correlation between predictor variables may reveal colinearity. \n",
    "   \n",
    "5. What are the risks and assumptions of your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "  > The risks include the lack of time-based information on the data, so at best, only correlations can be assumed, not causation. It is also assumed that this data has been randomly sampled with no bias and that there are no other confounding variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is your exploratory analysis plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above information, write an exploratory analysis plan that would allow you or a colleague to reproduce your analysis 1 year from now.\n",
    "\n",
    "   >Answer:\n",
    "1. Collect data\n",
    "2. Review dataset\n",
    "3. Plot density and box plots for continuous variables\n",
    "4. Perform descriptive statistics and review Mean, Mode, Median, and Standard Deviation\n",
    "5. Plot scatter plot of continuous variables and review correlation coefficient \n",
    "6. Review the skewness and kurtosis\n",
    "7. Create dummy variables for categorical variables\n",
    "8. Report the correlations that exist\n",
    "9. A heatmap will help to visualize the above correlations\n",
    "10. Using statsmodel, perform regression to review the predictive value of age, location, profession, days since last log in and activity score.\n",
